			<p id="description">Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals. The giraffe's  distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humansâ€”about 6 feet, allowing giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and 10 miles an hour over longer distances. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants. They live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations.</p>
